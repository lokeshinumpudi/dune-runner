### **Level Design for Desert Oasis**

#### **Core Concept:**

- The level will have multiple platforming sections with a mix of solid ancient structures and unstable sand-covered ruins.
- Players must traverse through crumbling platforms, shifting sands, and hidden underground passages to progress.

#### **Verticality & Exploration:**

- The level incorporates vertical gameplay, with climbing elements on crumbling temple walls.
- Secret tunnels and hidden caves reward exploration, offering supplies or hidden lore elements.
- Jump pads and wind gusts (represented by desert updrafts) help the player reach higher areas.

#### **Environmental Hazards & Challenges:**

- Quick-sinking sand pits that force players to find stable ground quickly.
- Crumbling platforms that fall after a short delay when stepped on.
- Periodic sandstorms that obscure visibility and push players backward if they are not sheltered.
- Rock slides that trigger based on player movement, requiring precise timing.

#### **Enemy & NPC Interactions:**

- Small robotic drones scouting the ruins, alerting larger enemies if the player is detected.
- Desert scavengers hiding within the ruins, offering quests or trades in exchange for rare materials.
- Ancient automated defense turrets in certain sections of the temple ruins, activated by proximity.

#### **Puzzle Elements:**

- Players must manipulate ancient mechanisms (e.g., rotating stone dials, pressure plates) to unlock doors and create new paths.
- Water reservoirs hidden in the ruins can be used to solidify shifting sands, making platforms stable for a short period.
- A hidden chamber containing a valuable artifact or game lore, requiring players to decipher ancient symbols to unlock.

#### **Aesthetic & Atmosphere:**

- The mix of warm, glowing sunset tones and cool shadowy ruins creates a visually striking balance.
- Dynamic lighting that shifts as the sun moves lower, creating new shadows and making some paths more difficult.
- Soft ambient desert wind effects, distant animal calls, and occasional deep rumbles of shifting dunes add immersion.

#### **Final Challenge & Level Exit:**

- The level culminates in a final gauntlet where players must outrun a massive rolling sand wave.
- Reaching the end rewards the player with a cutscene revealing a larger mystery tied to the desert ruins.
- The exit leads into a hidden underground network, teasing the next levelâ€™s setting.
