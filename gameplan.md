# ðŸš€ Phaser.js 2.5D Sci-Fi Platformer Development Plan

This document outlines a structured approach to building a **Dune-inspired 2.5D sci-fi platformer** using Phaser.js. The development will be broken down into five stages, progressing from basic setup to full gameplay implementation.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Stage 1: Setting Up the Development Environment** (Day 1-2)

**Goal:** Get Phaser.js up and running with a basic game loop.

### âœ… Install Phaser.js

1. Create a new project folder:
   ```sh
   mkdir sci-fi-platformer && cd sci-fi-platformer
   npm init -y
   ```
2. Install Phaser via npm:
   ```sh
   npm install phaser
   ```
3. Create an `index.html` file and load Phaser.

### âœ… Basic Game Structure

- Create `main.js` to handle Phaser setup.
- Initialize a **Phaser Scene** (`BootScene.js`).
- Render a simple sprite (e.g., a placeholder character).

ðŸ“Œ **Deliverable:** A black screen with a player sprite appearing in the middle.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Stage 2: Core Game Mechanics (Movement & Physics)** (Day 3-7)

**Goal:** Implement platforming movement (jumping, dashing, wall climbing).

### âœ… Player Controls

- Add left/right movement (`cursors.left`, `cursors.right`).
- Implement jumping with gravity & double-jump ability.
- Implement dashing (short burst forward).

### âœ… Physics Engine (Arcade Physics)

- Add collision detection for platforms.
- Handle player-landed & jumping state.

ðŸ“Œ **Deliverable:** A functional player character moving and jumping on platforms.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Stage 3: World & Level Design (Sci-Fi Desert)** (Day 8-14)

**Goal:** Create the **Dune-like world** with parallax backgrounds, sandstorms, and ancient ruins.

### âœ… Parallax Backgrounds (Depth Effect)

- Layered images to create **2.5D depth**.
- Use **AI tools (Stable Diffusion, Scenario.gg)** to generate backgrounds.

### âœ… Level Design

- Use **Tiled (Map Editor)** to create level layouts.
- Import tilemaps into Phaser.js.

### âœ… Dynamic Environments

- Add **sandstorms** (fog overlay + particle effects).
- Implement moving platforms and interactive objects.

ðŸ“Œ **Deliverable:** A visually engaging level with interactive elements.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Stage 4: Enemies, AI & Combat System** (Day 15-21)

**Goal:** Implement enemies, AI behavior, and combat mechanics.

### âœ… Enemy AI

- Basic enemy movement (patrolling, chasing player).
- Add enemy attacks (melee & ranged).

### âœ… Combat System

- Player attacks (melee, ranged, or special abilities).
- Damage system (health, shields, death animations).

ðŸ“Œ **Deliverable:** A working combat system with enemies.

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Stage 5: UI, Sound, and Final Polish** (Day 22-30)

**Goal:** Add menus, sound, animations, and final touches.

### âœ… User Interface (UI)

- Main menu, pause menu, HUD (health, ammo, score).
- Implement settings (volume, difficulty, controls).

### âœ… Audio & Effects

- Background music & SFX (footsteps, weapon sounds, enemy noises).
- AI-generated soundtracks (Boomy, AIVA).

### âœ… Final Polish

- Add post-processing effects (shaders, lighting, animations).
- Optimize performance for smooth gameplay.

ðŸ“Œ **Deliverable:** A playable, polished prototype ready for feedback.

---

## **ðŸ”® Future Enhancements (Beyond MVP)**

- Procedurally generated levels for replayability.
- Multiplayer co-op mode.
- Expanded lore with NPC interactions.

ðŸš€ **Now, let's start building!**
